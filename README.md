This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project provides a small text-to-speech playground using the [Kokoro](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro) model.  The UI is built with Next.js and Shadcn.

## Setup

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Place your ONNX model in the `models` directory and voice binaries in the `voices` directory at the project root.

### API

Two endpoints are available:

- `GET /api/voices` – returns the list of available voices
- `POST /api/generate` – generate audio from text. The body should include `text`, optional `voice` and `speed`.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
